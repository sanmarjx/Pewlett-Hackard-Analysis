## Overview
The purpose of this project is to help Pewlett-Hackard be prepared for the upcoming “silver tsunami”. A great number of employees will begin retiring in the next few years. In order to prepare for this event, the company wants detailed information on the number of future retires from all departments as well as staff eligibility to create a mentorship program for new employees.
## Results

## Summary
- At the monment there are 72,458 roles that will need to be filled in the next few years due to employee retirement. This is a very large number so the company needs to get ahead of this and start hiring new staff now so there is a successful transition. 
- The number of upcoming retirees (72,458) is much larger than those eligible for the mentorship program (1,549). This would mean that each eligible employee would need to mentor over 46 employees, those are a lot of mentees for each mentor. The mentorship program is a good idea but the company might need to expand its eligibility pool.
